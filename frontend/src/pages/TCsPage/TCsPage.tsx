        </ul>
        <h3>2. Reviews must be relevant and based on real experiences</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            2.1. Spam and fake content: Reviews ought to reflect genuine
            experiences of being a student enrolled in the course being
            reviewed. Additionally reviews shouldn&apos;t be posted for the
            purpose of manipulating a course&apos;s ratings. Don&apos;t post
            fake reviews and don&apos;t post a review multiple times.
          </li>
          <li>2.2. Off-topic: Only post reviews based on your experience while
            being enrolled in the relevant UNSW course. Our platform is not
            meant to be a forum for solicitation of goods and services,
            political or social commentary, or any other unrelated topics.
            Reviews which fail to meet this will be removed.
          </li>
          <li>2.3. Illegal content: Any review that describes or links to
            illegal activity will be removed. This includes but is not limited
            to; sexual abuse imagery, descriptions of illegal products or
            services, descriptions of graphic violence, or anything that
            violates any laws, rules or regulations.
          </li>
          <li>2.4. Offensive content: Any review that contain profane, obscene
            or offensive language, will be removed.
          </li>
          <li>2.5. Malicious content: Any review that attempts to distribute or
            upload material that contain malicious code or any other potentially
            harmful program or material, will be removed.
          </li>
          <li>
            2.6. Dangerous Content: Our platform is a place for safe
            communication, for this reason we don&apos;t permit reviewers to
            post dangerous content, including descriptions that:
            <ul>
              <li>
                2.6.1. Threatens or advocates harm on oneself or others.
              </li>
              <li>2.6.2. Harasses, intimidates or bullies an individual or group
                of individuals.</li>
              <li>2.6.3. Promotes discrimination of an individual or group based
                on their race, religion, disability,
                age, nationality, sexual orientation, gender identity or any
                other characteristic that is associated with discrimination.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            2.7. Impersonation: We don&apos;t allow individuals to write
            deceptive reviews as well as undertake false representations.
          </li>
          <li>
            2.8. Conflict of interest: Reviews are most valuable when they are
            unbiased and honest. An example of a practice we would disapprove
            of; if a staff member for the course, writes a review for a term
            for which they were not a student.
          </li>
        </ul>
        In summary, reviews which are deliberately faked, off-topic, use
        defamatory language, or engage in personal attacks are all in violation
        of our policy. We will remove reviews that violate our terms &
        conditions and can suspend abusive contributors.
        <h3>3. Reviews must be respectful</h3>
        Non-exhaustive criterion:
        <ul>
          <li>2.1. Be thoughtful, fair and constructive.</li>
          <li>2.2. Have a focus on the learning and teaching activities, provide
            relevant examples to illustrate your point.
          </li>
          <li>2.3. Avoid comments which are personal or inappropriate such as
            comments about dress or appearance.</li>
          <li>2.4. Avoid giving out private information, such as phone numbers,
            email addresses or social media links.
          </li>
          <li>
            2.5. Do not write anything that is offensive, racist or sexist.
          </li>
        </ul>
        Some examples of good reviews:
        <ul>
          <li>Instead of saying &quot;The course was great.&quot;  explain why
            the class was great. For example - &quot;The course was great. The
            lectures were well organised and presented and the explanations were
            easy to follow. People were very talkative in tutorials and I learnt
            a lot from my tutor who was very experienced. Additionally the
            teacher used visual examples that made things easy to understand.
            Overall the content was difficult but very practical and
            interesting.&quot;.
          </li>
          <li>Instead of &quot;I couldn&apos;t understand anything the lecturer
            said, a boring and useless course&quot;, try &quot;They should
            explain difficult concepts in depth, rather than relying on slides.
            When they used jargon that we didn&apos;t know, I had trouble taking
            notes because I didn&apos;t understand the words well enough. The
            content could be more engaging and useful if they showed practical
            usage of concepts taught. &quot;
          </li>
        </ul>
